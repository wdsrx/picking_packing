# Open Orders Performance

A live dhasboard that shows the number of Sales Orders pending for picking and the activity per employee and a comparison with the previous day.

The 'Dashboard' that is displayed in a 65 inches monitor in the middle of the warehouse, has the intention to increase productivity performance by modifying only one variable: '24 hours monitoring system'.
