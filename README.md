# Open Orders Performance

This is a live dhasboard that shows the number of Sales Orders pending for picking and the activity per employee and a comparison with the previous day.

The 'Dashboard' that is displayed in a 65 inches monitor in the middle of the warehouse, has the intention to increase productivity performance by modifying only one variable: '24 hours monitoring system'.

To prove the hypotesis that employees productivity increses when they feel they are being monitored, I will create another chart that compares the data before and after the dashboard was published.

Early in the morning, the dashboard displays zero activity and the number of orders picked and packed the previous day.

The dashboard is devided in three parts:
1. Total Open Orders: Sales orders that need to be picked and packed.
2. 

During the day, the dashboard shows the name of the employees that are picking orders as well as packing. Without a single word, everyone can see who morks the most and who doesnt.
